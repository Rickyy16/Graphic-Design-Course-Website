        Graphic design is all around us, in a myriad of forms, both on screen and in print, yet it is always made up of
        images and words to create a communication goal. This four-course sequence exposes students to the fundamental
        skills required to make sophisticated graphic design: process, historical context, and communication through
        image-making and typography. The sequence is completed by a capstone project that applies the skills of each
        course and peer feedback in a finished branding project suitable for a professional portfolio.
